# Calculator in C-Sharp
In this repository, we have implemented a set of arithmetic operators including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/). The user interface also includes the option to delete the entire input, the input with the last result, or the last character entered, allowing for easy corrections and editing.

Our application also supports numbers in decimal and negative forms, providing versatility and adaptability to any mathematical task.

We invite you to explore the code and see for yourself the functionality of these operators and editing options. With the added support for decimal and negative numbers, this tool is suitable for any mathematical problem.
